This is a project on sentiment analysis using machine learning algorithms.
Sentiments are basically an expressed opinion or view and it can be of various types like positive-negative, neutral, happy-sad etc. 
Sentiment analysis is a tool used to analyze texts for polarity i.e. positive to negative. By training the machines, they automatically learn to detect sentiment without human input.These models can detect beyond mere definitions like sarcasm, context or misapplied words.
